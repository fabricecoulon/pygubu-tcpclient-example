# pygubu-tcpclient-example

This is an example application based on the python module [pygubu](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu).

Tcpclientk is two things: a TCP client and a GUI based on [python3](https://www.python.org/), [pygubu](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu) and [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter).

Previously, writing portable simple GUIs was a difficult task, now thanks
to [pygubu](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu), almost everybody can do it.

Anyway, [pygubu](https://github.com/alejandroautalan/pygubu) deserves more example code, this is why I've started to
write this example.
